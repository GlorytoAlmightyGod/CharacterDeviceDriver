Makefile should be the name of the make file!

uname -r gives current version of linux kernel!

PWD gives path to current working directory!

exit function of a module must be of type void!

in make file := represents initialization of object!
whereas      += represents assignment of an object!

insmod is used to load modules in the kernel!

rmmod is used to remove modules from the kernel!

/var/log/syslog is log file for the kernel on system!

/proc/devices contains char & block devices loaded in the current kernel along with major number!

mknod is used to create device specific files!

Atomic, meaning that the entire operation happens at once as far as other threads of execution are concerned!
An Atomic context is simply a state where multiple steps must be performed without any sort of concurrent access.

Be damn careful while passing extra arguement to ioctl & also choosing numbers while using ioctl!

Incase of any problem in system's performance just reboot.
